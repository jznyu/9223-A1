## Pull Requests

### Porposing a change
If you would like to request a new feature or enhancement but are not yet thinking about opening a pull request, you can also file an issue using the [feature template](https://github.com/jznyu/9223-A1/issues/new?template=feature_request.md).

If you're only fixing a bug, it's fine to submit a pull request right away, but we still recommend that you file an issue detailing what you're fixing. This is helpful in case we don't accept that specific fix but want to keep track of the issue.

Small pull requests are much easier to review and more likely to get merged.

### Installation
Ensure you have npm installed. After cloning the repository, run `npm install`.

### Creating a branch
Fork the [repository](https://github.com/jznyu/9223-A1) and create your branch from `main`.
