Part 3: Scrub Old Secrets - Writeup
========================================

Commands Used to Remove personal.txt from Repository History
------------------------------------------------------------

1. Made git-filter-repo executable:
   
   chmod +x git-filter-repo

2. Used git-filter-repo to remove personal.txt from entire git history:
   
   python3 ./git-filter-repo --path personal.txt --invert-paths --force

   Explanation of flags:
   - --path personal.txt: Specifies the file to operate on
   - --invert-paths: Inverts the selection (removes the file instead of keeping only it)
   - --force: Required because we're operating on a non-fresh clone

3. Re-added the remote (git-filter-repo removes it for safety):
   
   git remote add origin https://github.com/jznyu/9223-A1.git

4. Force pushed the rewritten history to the remote repository:
   
   git push origin --force --all

   Note: --force is necessary because we've rewritten history, which changes
   commit hashes. This is a destructive operation and should be used carefully.

Results:
--------
- personal.txt was successfully removed from all commits in the repository history
- The file was also removed from the working directory
- Git-filter-repo processed 37 commits and rewrote the history in 0.21 seconds
- The commit that originally added personal.txt (2cf0919) no longer contains it

Important Notes:
---------------
- Force pushing rewrites history and can cause issues for collaborators
- Anyone else who has cloned the repository will need to reclone it or reset their local copy
- This operation is irreversible once pushed to remote
- Always ensure you have backups before performing such operations
